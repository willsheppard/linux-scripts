Scripts for productivity

An effort has been made to generalise the scripts so they work in different environments, not just for the company they were written.

Scripts which are not included, as they must be written from scratch for each company because they are completely environment-specific:
* *f* - find files in the checked-out source, excluding unwanted directories
* *a* - grep/ack for text in the checked-out source, excluding unwanted files and directories
* *sql* - connect to the local database
* *vimmod* - given a perl module name, translate it into a filename (depending on idiosyncrasies of the source tree) and open that file in vim
